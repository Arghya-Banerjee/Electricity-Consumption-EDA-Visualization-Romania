# Electricity Consumption EDA & Visualizations

This Notebook is made to visualize the trends of Power Consumption as well as Production in Romania with respect to different Power Production types of both Renewanle and Non-Renewable Energy sources.

Later in the Notebook Power Consumption to Power Production is also visualized by grouping the given data in Months and Day of the Week.

Hope you will enjoy this Notebook
